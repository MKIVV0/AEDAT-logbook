# Book introduction
This book compiles the detailed logs of experiments conducted as part of the <a href="https://uninsubria.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2023/26425/2018/1/10094?coorte=2023&schemaid=5390">ADVANCED EXPERIMENTAL AND DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS</a> course in the master's degree program at <a href="https://www.uninsubria.it/">Universit√† degli studi dell'Insubria</a>, during the AY 2023/2024. 

Written collaboratively by a **Computer Science student** and a **Physics student**, both pursuing their **master's degrees**, this logbook reflects our joint efforts to blend our diverse skills. By teaming up, we aim to build a well-rounded proficiency in computational data analysis.

Under the guidance of <a href="https://uninsubria.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/docente/353/2023">professor Caccia</a> and <a href="https://uninsubria.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/docente/36596/2023">professor Santoro</a>, this collaboration is a valuable opportunity for us to learn from each other and combine our strengths. We invite you to explore this logbook, witnessing the intersection of computer science and physics in our exploration of experimental and data analysis techniques.
