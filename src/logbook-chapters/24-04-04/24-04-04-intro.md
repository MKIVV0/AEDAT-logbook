## Preparatory Details
We began with a single file containing \\(N = 1.37 \times 10^5\\) measurements, all taken within a one-minute time window.

The file is structured as \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots, x_{N}\\), with each data point representing the amplitude of the signals. Despite the file containing various waveforms, we standardized the acquisition window to \\(l = 1030\\) data points, resulting in \\( \frac{N}{l} \\) waveforms.

To better manage the mixed waveforms in the file, we organized them into a matrix, where each row represents one waveform:


\\[
    % \cdots is used for hotizontal dots
    % \vdots is used for vertical dots
    % \ddots is used for diagonal dots
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} & \cdots & x_{1,1030} \newline
    x_{2,1} & x_{2,2} & \cdots & x_{2,1030} \newline
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \newline
    x_{k,1} & x_{k,2} & \cdots & x_{k,1030} \newline
    \end{bmatrix}
\\]

This arrangement yields a \\(k \times l\\) matrix, where \\(k = \frac{N}{l}\\).
