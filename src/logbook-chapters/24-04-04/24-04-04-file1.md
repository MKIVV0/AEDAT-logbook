# Waveform Characterization
## The Problem
Our analysis aims to investigate the presence of correlation among the datapoints representing the baseline on the left-hand side of the signals obtained from SiPM waveforms. The baseline, representing the initial stable portion of the waveform, carries important information about the detector's response to incident photons.

To initiate this investigation, we focus on verifying a specific condition for each waveform, involving the calculation of variance. The condition we seek to verify is expressed as follows:

\\[ \sigma^2 = N \cdot \sigma_j^2 \\]

Here, \\( \sigma^2 \\) represents the variance of the entire baseline, while \\( N \\) signifies the number of points summed within each data chunk, and \\( \sigma_j^2 \\) denotes the variance of those \\( N \\) points at a given iteration \( j \).

This relationship suggests that the overall variance of the baseline (\\( \sigma^2 \\)) should equal \\( N \\) times the sum of variances of individual data chunks (\\( \sigma_j^2 \\)) calculated at each iteration \\( j \\).

By verifying this condition across multiple waveforms, we aim to gain insights into the correlation structure among baseline datapoints. Understanding the correlation within the baseline can provide valuable information about the stability and consistency of the SiPM's response to incident photons.

This investigation serves as a crucial step in our broader analysis of SiPM waveform data, enabling us to optimize signal extraction, noise rejection, and performance evaluation of the detectors. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for advanced data analysis techniques, such as pulse shape discrimination and time-of-flight measurements, by providing insights into the underlying characteristics of the waveforms.

Overall, by rigorously examining the variance relationship within baseline datapoints, we aim to enhance our understanding of SiPM behavior and improve the effectiveness of SiPM-based detection systems.
